I had a great time at the 7th Manipulation Workshop in Edinburgh where I presented my project "Shared Autonomy for Failure Recovery in Robotic Manipulation". 

I really enjoyed talking to fellow roboticists about the latest trends in tactile sensors, robotics AI, safety and dexterous object manipulation.

Thanks to the organizers for a brilliant event!
